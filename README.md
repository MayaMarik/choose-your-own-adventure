# Choose Your Own Adventure

Welcome to the Adventure Text Game, a simple, interactive command-line journey where your choices determine your fate. Beware, as not all decisions lead to a happy ending!

This game is entirely text-based. As you progress through the story, you'll be presented with choices that determine the outcome of your journey. 

This game demonstrates the use of basic Python concepts including input() and print() for user interaction, conditional statements for decision-making, and string manipulation to customize messages. It also employs ANSI escape codes for text formatting and organizes the code into a linear flow for a simple, interactive experience. By creating this project, I gained experience in building a text-based adventure game with branching paths and multiple outcomes.
